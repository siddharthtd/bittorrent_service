Bit-torrent is a client-server and a peer-to-peer architecture based hybrid service. It enables file sharing between users who possess this service. The file needs to be shared between the users and the 'tracker' keeps a track of the status of the torrent file and the number of users that are using it.

This file will be periodically udpated according to the developments of the project.
